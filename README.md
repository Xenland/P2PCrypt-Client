#Abstract Goal of P2P Crypt Client & Servers
Provide global use of communications ran by the world instead of a single (or multiple) centralized controllable entity. To provide free and paid incentives in a way that each *server operator* will strive to run a *P2P Server Node* themselves 24 hours a day in either hopes of **profit** or **communication freedom**. Also at the same time allowing "mixed" incentives for the *server operator* to set-up their node how they wish to be compensated for their *clients* to use their resources so that there will be a good balance of "Free" and "Paid" services across the globe accommodating the dynamic needs of the world that no one entity can practically provide.

###What is designed to be free for all?
All *P2P Server Nodes* should allow the storage & relay of all identities for free and with out payment from the client(bandwidth or connection limiting is encouraged); However due to the nature of P2P this cannot be guaranteed so it is hoped that a majority (80%+) will be supplying the only essential of the P2P Crypt protocol as everything else is considered a "convenience" or a "feature" and these "conveniences" are in some cases necessary to charge, subscriptions, etc to maintain necessary resource availability for the "said" clients.

###What features are planned besides the alternative to paid centralized Certificate Authorities?
The major features consist of **Always-On** encrypted Voice, Video, and Text messaging communications(Not to be confused with SMS). **Always-On** is a "enforced" feature that requires all communications to be **Always-Encrypted** connections, as this is to lessen the paranoid feeling or perhaps more accurately lessen the "Is it really working?" thought process, If you have connected to your recipient you can be rest assured **It's Working**. Some other features of the protocol also include **Anonymous/Semi-anonymous Gaming**, **More to be listed**
